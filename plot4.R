# Using the base plotting system, this R code file creates a PNG file with a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from coal combustion-related sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
# The generated plot serves answering the following question: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
