# Using the base plotting system, this R code file creates a PNG file with a plot showing PM2.5 emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City, Maryland, for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
# The generated plot serves answering the following question: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
